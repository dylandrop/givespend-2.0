<h4>A new way of funding for nonprofits</h4><br>
<p>Our goal is to give nonprofits and charities who might have a good cause to support, but not enough funding to do so, easy and sustainable monetary backing. Unfortunately in today's world, nonprofit organizations almost always have only two ways of finding funds: either through donations, which can be unreliable, or merchandizing, which can be costly and stretch resources thin. Givespend aims to alleviate this by giving nonprofits a way to fundraise with virtually no effort on their part.</p><br>
<h4>You can give back without the extra stress</h4><br>
<p>Donations are tricky: you want to give to a good cause, but financial stress tends to pull you in the other direction. Donations are often dismissed as a future possibility, but never a reality: "I'll be able to do that once I pay off my school loans", or "I can give a little, but it's just too hard to give more right now". Shouldn't there be an easier way to give without feeling anxious? By giving something, and getting something in return, you can achieve the balance that works for you.</p><br>
